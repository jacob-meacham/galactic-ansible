# galactic-ansible

A gamma blast has scoured the dominant race, the Aaxians (a dark matter, silicon-based lifeform), from the universe. Beyond a few, crumbling monuments, their only legacy is the galactic ansible, a solar-system sized computer capable of faster-than-light communication. It has somehow gotten ahold of a twitter account, and is fruitlessly continuing its goal of documenting the universe.
